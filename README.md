To find out more about [CollectReflect blinds](http://www.sva.lt/en/catalog/collect-reflec-thermal-blinds/)

This app is a fork of [Particle android app](https://github.com/particle-iot/photon-tinker-android).
Rebranded and adjusted to serve as MVP for controlling CollectReflect thermal blinds. With this app
You can specify and track preferred room microclimate parameters, control blinds manually or 
automatically, individually or in groups, ensuring highest comfort and energy economy.

Application allows to easily connect your blinds and microclimate sensors to a Wi-Fi network in a
few simple steps. The app will then take you through the entire set-up process step by step until
the LED on your blinds is breathing cyan - indicating it's connected and ready to serve!

## Open source project

### Requirements

1. [Android Studio 1.2](http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html) or higher, and all the latest
SDK components (Just launch the SDK Manager, wait for the progress bar at the bottom of the screen
to finish, let it select all the updates, and hit the "Install X packages" button in the lower right
corner)
2. Once you have Android Studio installed, launch it, and from the "Welcome to Android Studio"
screen, pick "Open an existing Android Studio project".  When it prompts you for the project
location, point it at the top-level 'build.gradle' file in the repo.
3. Once AS has finished its initial cogitating\*, hit the "play" button on the toolbar to build and
run the app on a device.

\* No, really, if you've just installed AS and are running it for the first time, you may want to
get a cup of coffee during this part.  And then drink that coffee slowly, perhaps while
reading [this documentation on how to speed up your Android Studio install](http://tools.android.com/tech-docs/configuration#TOC-Increasing-IDE-Memory).
